Dakshin kali is typically shown with her right foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakali (typically shown with her left foot on Shiva's chest). Animal sacrifices, particularly of cockerels and uncastrated male goats, are the main way that the goddess is worshipped, and this is especially seen during the Dashain festival. Dakshin Kali Temple has also the same religious value as Pashupatinath Temple and Manakamana Temple in Nepal.

    "description": "The Chisapani Gadhi is a fort in Bhimphedi, Makwanpur that was built around 1744–1745 AD. The fort was controlled by the Sen Dynasty but after the Gorkha Kingdom (later became known as the Kingdom of Nepal) captured Makwanpur they used the fort for the military, administrative, trade and immigration purposes. King Prithvi Narayan Shah used it to create an economic blockade to the Kathmandu Valley. According to historians, the fort had a court, a check post, and an office for a local governor. During the Anglo-Nepalese War, commander Ranabir Singh Thapa deployed many soldiers inside the fort. But the forces did not directly face the East India Company. Thapa at the Makwanpur Gadhi stopped the Company troops from getting into the fort, and they subsequently went moved to capture the Sim Bhanjyang instead.",

Explorations of these caves by conservators and archaeologists have also led to the discovery of valuable Buddhist paintings, sculptures, manuscripts and numerous artifacts belonging to the 12th to 14th century. The caves lie on the steep valley walls near the Kali Gandaki River in Upper Mustang. Research groups have continued to investigate these caves, but no one has yet understood who built the caves and why they were built. The site is currently listed as a UNESCO tentative site since 1996.",
